Authors of bsd-games and bsd-games-non-free
===========================================

The bsd-games package was originally created by Curt Olson
<curt@me.umn.edu> and Andy Tefft <teffta@engr.dnet.ge.com>.  The games
themselves were written by many contributers to *BSD over the past
twenty years or so.  Maintenance of the package was passed to me in
1997; I divided it into bsd-games and bsd-games-non-free according to
the established (DFSG/OSD) definition, following the division used for
the Debian package of 1.3.  Much of the packaging has been written or
extensively modified by myself.  Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
wrote the manpages for wargames and paranoia.

Based on the source and manpages, here are the details of the people
who originally wrote the games over more than 20 years.  Many of the
email addresses below are probably no longer valid.  Please send any
further information you have to help improve this list.
